# League of Legends Quick Build viewer (LQB)
### Displays:
- Runes
- Starting Items
- Full Build
- Skill Order

### Why did I make this:
I infrequently play LoL and I'm not skilled enough to fully understand Runes and Items or why I should be using them. As a result I would frequently look up Build / Rune guides. This script cuts down the time it takes for me to extract the information I need in the limited time I get in champion-select.

## Example:
